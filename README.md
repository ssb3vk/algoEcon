# algoEcon
Repository for Algorithmic Economics Spring 2022

ALL PROJECTS WERE CONDUCTED IN COOPERATION WITH Kelvin Ping and Param Damle. 

This class was taught in the Spring Semester of 2022 by Dennis Nekipolev and Haifeng Xu. This course proceeded in the following sequence: 
> Part 1: Single-Agent Decision Making
  > Preferences, utilities, and information; Economic behavior with private in-formation; Bayesian updating and Bayesian learning
  > Introduction to machine learning, and (Probably Approximately Correct) PAC learnability; Convex learning problems and gradient methods

> Part 2: Multi-Agent Decisino Making in Single-Shot Interactions
  > Online learning; The concept of regret; Online learning under full information feedback and bandit information feedback
  > Stability of environments with online learning agents; Nash equilibrium and Correlated equilibrium; Learning algorithms and implementation of an equilibrium
  
> Part 3: Multi-Agent Decision Making in Sequential Dynamic Environments
  > System with long-run feedback; Dynamic optimization and dynamic Markov games with incomplete information
  > Reinforcement learning; Model-based and model-free algorithms for reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learning algorithms as strategies in dynamic Markove games
  

Along with the afore-mentioned content. There were 3 projects associated with the course, the contents of which can be seen in the repo. The Final Submission folders 
in each repository contain the relevant final submission for each product but feel free to parse each folder as you like. 

Project 1 was an analysis on the grocery purchases of multiple agents. The second was an analysis of EXP3 and MWU algorithms via a zero-sum game. 
The third and final project tested multiple algorithm's abilities to play blackjack.
